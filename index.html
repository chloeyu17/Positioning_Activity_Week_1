    <h1>Lady Macbeth Monologue</h1>
    <p class="content">
        'They met me in the day of success: and I have
        learned by the perfectest report, they have more in
        them than mortal knowledge. When I burned in desire
        to question them further, they made themselves air,
        into which they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt in
        the wonder of it, came missives from the king, who
        all-hailed me 'Thane of Cawdor;' by which title,
        before, these weird sisters saluted me, and referred
        me to the coming on of time, with 'Hail, king that
        shalt be!' This have I thought good to deliver
        thee, my dearest partner of greatness, that thou
        mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being
        ignorant of what greatness is promised thee. Lay it
        to thy heart, and farewell.'
        Glamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be
        What thou art promised: yet do I fear thy nature;
        It is too full o' the milk of human kindness
        To catch the nearest way: thou wouldst be great;
        Art not without ambition, but without
        The illness should attend it: what thou wouldst highly,
        That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,
        And yet wouldst wrongly win: thou'ldst have, great Glamis,
        That which cries 'Thus thou must do, if thou have it;
        And that which rather thou dost fear to do
        Than wishest should be undone.' Hie thee hither,
        That I may pour my spirits in thine ear;
        And chastise with the valour of my tongue
        All that impedes thee from the golden round,
        Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem
        To have thee crown'd withal.

        The raven himself is hoarse
That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan
Under my battlements. Come, you spirits
That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,
And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full
Of direst cruelty! make thick my blood;
Stop up the access and passage to remorse,
That no compunctious visitings of nature
Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between
The effect and it! Come to my woman's breasts,
And take my milk for gall, you murdering ministers,
Wherever in your sightless substances
You wait on nature's mischief! Come, thick night,
And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,
That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,
Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark,
To cry 'Hold, hold!'
